## Overview and Project Goals
The [goal](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html) of this group project that was made for Mod 3 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) is to learn to use React in order to create an application for users to have access to information about a selection of movies. 

## Why was this project created?
To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:
1. Gaining competency with React fundementals.
2. Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
3. Create a multi-page UX using Router

## Features
* A website that allows a user to view a selection of films, and click on whichever they may be interested in viewing. 
* The user can view more details about each film such as an overview, genres, rating, budget, revenue, and more. 
* Users can search for a specific film through a search bar. 
* Users can also view a randomly selected film at the top of the home page.
